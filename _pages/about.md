I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at Duke University under the supervision of Professor Yiran Chen and Hai "Helen" Li in Duke CEI Lab. My research interests lie in machine learning and privacy, with a focus on federated learning and collaborative intelligent systems with the awareness of effciency, security and privacy.
